    - see if there's some way to create functions that can call in scenes so we just call those instead of a bunch of calls
    - for example if joy is interacting in the bathroom, we might need joy to be able to walk around the bathroom


minigame ideas:
    examining a bunch of patients for diagnoses - for example lungs, heart, tummy, lumps, etc.
    dating minigame - 3-phase mechanic. if you are charmed by end of phase 1 (the flirt), charmed by end of phase 2 (the date), and agree at the end of phase 3 (the intimacy), you're in a relationship. In each encounter, you can ENTER the phase with a score of 1-3, 1 is put off, 3 is flirt, 2 is neutral or unopinionated.

mechanics:
    the story so far -- on resume the last 5 "critical" dialogue scenes get played back. probably some annotation system, which also denotes unskippable, and the text slows down, etc.
    aside - when talking to you, the world "greys out", except for her silhouette and whatever is important.
        her face also changes to her TRUE expression, so some funny anime cariacture.
    // means greyed out option - in that moment, joy is so clear minded, she would never even think those other things.
    randomiztion - the player responses are not in the same places, so no paragon/renegade categorization.
