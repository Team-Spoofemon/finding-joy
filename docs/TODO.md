# Features
maybe have a whole library of sfx so that when non-joy characters talk, each dialogue or so you get a new sfx?

ideas:
    define a few emotions!
    if you can get a few standard emotions, that would be super helpful
    maybe to cut down on asset resources, rather than having sitting standing, we can do a zoom in fade type situation


animations and scene to scene transitions...
    $ renpy.pause (delay, hard=True)


as a1d3s1 demonstrates, we may need a layering system...


- logo
- non woke config, no woke is just "every choice doesnt correlate"
- title page Splash screen - https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/splashscreen_presplash.html#adding-a-splashscreen
- end credits
- do we have a speedruning component and save the animals?
- does customizing her hair make saving the eagle hard
- branching story (to some extent)
- each minigame is used ONLY ONCE, similar to the mario concept where thye have unique power ups per world, fire flower, etc.
- a metacommentary
- compelling characters
- minigames
- grey-out
- layered images
    - see if there's some way to create functions that can call in scenes so we just call those instead of a bunch of calls
    - for example if joy is interacting in the bathroom, we might need joy to be able to walk around the bathroom
- character creator
    - you can pick from different avatars for JOY, some are gender expressioned, some are gender expressionless
- "the next day" needs to be able to scroll very slowly
- we need test to display like a typewriter, change fonts, etc.

minigame ideas:
    examining a bunch of patients for diagnoses - for example lungs, heart, tummy, lumps, etc.
    dating minigame - 3-phase mechanic. if you are charmed by end of phase 1 (the flirt), charmed by end of phase 2 (the date), and agree at the end of phase 3 (the intimacy), you're in a relationship. In each encounter, you can ENTER the phase with a score of 1-3, 1 is put off, 3 is flirt, 2 is neutral or unopinionated.
    minigame: https://www.reddit.com/r/VetTech/comments/1itae3j/ear_cytology_help/
    I wonder if there's a "blah blah blah" minigame that can be done where the goal is to remove as many words coming in as possible so that it goes in one ear and out comes blah blah blah on the other... so you just have to keep up with the words and erasing them and nod your head form time to time.

mechanics:
    the story so far -- on resume the last 5 "critical" dialogue scenes get played back. probably some annotation system, which also denotes unskippable, and the text slows down, etc.
    aside - when talking to you, the world "greys out", except for her silhouette and whatever is important.
        her face also changes to her TRUE expression, so some funny anime cariacture.
    // means greyed out option - in that moment, joy is so clear minded, she would never even think those other things.
    randomiztion - the player responses are not in the same places, so no paragon/renegade categorization.

make each character a play on things, like joy is joy, from incredibles 2 evelyn deavor is EVIL ENDEAVOUR
