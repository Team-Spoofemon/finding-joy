# ACT 1 - DAY 3 - SCENE 5 - INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - JOY sits across POMPO and they talk but JOY is not going to let POMPO romance them.

JOY and POMPO walk back to the table, coffee in hand, sit down, and start talking.

POMPO
I think the coffee got a little bit more expensive. And they still want tips?

JOY
What’s wrong with tips?

POMPO
Prices are so high, shouldn’t that mean that business is fine and they don’t need tips?

JOY
I’m pretty sure this place doesn’t pass on those profits to the barista. Prices went up for dog blood testing and our pay isn’t going to go up either.

POMPO
Sure it will! Once the government gets rid of all of the waste and abuse their taxes are going to go down! Then they can pay people more and there won’t be any need for tips! I can’t wait.

JOY
You really think that’s what’s going to happen?

POMPO
Oh definitely. Now that the right person is in charge we can finally recruit more of the right people and get rid of everyone who’s been dragging the rest of us down.

JOY
If you say so.

POMPO
I didn’t think you’d be interested in talking about this kind of stuff. Isn’t this nice? We can do this every day if you want!

JOY
Tempting offer, but I'll have to pass.

POMPO pauses.

POMPO
What do you mean you’ll have to pass?

JOY
I mean that this thing is a one-time thing.

POMPO
One time? What, I'm not good enough for you?

JOY turns to WOE.

JOY
The FUCK did he just ask?

WOE
a) You're not into blowhards. Just tell him that. See how that goes.
// b) There's many fish in the sea! That's got to be new advice he's never heard before!
// c) I'm seeing someone. I'm definitely seeing someone.

JOY turns back.

JOY
a) Sorry, but I don't like the way you think and I don't like the way you talk--we wouldn't work. I think the world is complicated. You think the world is simple. It isn't.
// b) Sorry, I'm sure you're good enough for the right person, but I don't think that person is me.
// c) Sorry, I'm seeing someone.

POMPO
So now I'm stuck with the bill? Thanks a lot, feminism! Where's the equity here?

JOY gets up and walks offscreen (to pay the cash register for her coffee) and walks past POMPO. SHOPKEEPER approaches POMPO.

SHOPKEEPER
Your bill has been reduced by $4.50. Have a nice day, sir.

POMPO
