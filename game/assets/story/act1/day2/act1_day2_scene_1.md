Oh wow I see a few people are in the store already... I should say hi.

JOHN, MARY, SUSAN all enter stage right and are talking amongst themselves by facing stage right.

??? (MARY)
On god yesterday was trash. Is the new girl any good?

??? (SUSAN)
Honey you should just be grateful we've got help arriving. I'd take a warm body at this point if it'll help us.

??? (JOHN)
Yeah these days work is just stressing me out--

Hi there, I'm JOY, the new vet. It's great to meet you all!

SUSAN
I'm SUSAN, don't let the kids get on your nerves. I'm kidding of course.
