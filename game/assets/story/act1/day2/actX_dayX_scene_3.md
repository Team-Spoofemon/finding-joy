# ACT 1 - DAY 2 - SCENE 3 - JOY talks to POMPO again who comments on how KAREN is cute and asks what your type is

POMPO enters stage right.

POMPO
Man who was that leaving just now?

JOY
Oh POMPO, right?

POMPO
That's me, yup. Who was that?

JOY
Oh uh, I think her name was KAREN? She had a pomeranian poodle named Fiddles. I think she fed old or stale food and--

POMPO
Is she your type?

JOY
Wait what?

POMPO
We get lots of hot clients here, you must've sneaked a glance or two?

JOY
No not really, I was focused on treating Fiddles upset stomach. Why do you ask?

POMPO
Oh you know, lots of vets like you are into girls. I figure you must be too.

JOY
Oh uh, I uh wouldn't put it that way.

POMPO
Is that so? Than what is your type?

JOY
What the heck is happening here?

WOE
a) Chill chill, he's just flirting, you can handle this
b) Play dumb, that always works.
c) Freak him out.

JOY
a) Deep breaths, deep breaths, no point burning bridges on day one...
b) I'm just going to be be professional.
c) Intrusive thoughts begone! Those pesky intrusive thoughts!

JOY
They are a client who I just met--I'm not thinking about those kinds of things so soon on the job.

POMPO
Aww you're no fun! Let your hair down once in a while, loosen up! I've got some things to take care of, I'll be back.

JOY
Okay. I guess I'll see you then.

POMPO exits stage right.

JOY
This office is... colorful, to say the least.
