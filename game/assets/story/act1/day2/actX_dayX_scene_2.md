JOY
Hi there, welcome to PETCHEAP, my name is JOY. How can we help you?

KAREN
Yeah, I'm KAREN, hi, I'm in a bit of a rush. Can you look at my dog please? I'm in a meeting and my dog threw up all over the carpet and its a god damn mess. Can you believe this? What did I do to deserve this, you know? Today of all days--

JOY
Yes ma'am we can take a look and see what's the matter.

KAREN
Yes thank you, I'm so stressed right--are you an idiot? I told you no!

JOY
Looks like its a case of some bad food, we've got some medication that can help stabilize their tummy.

# MINIGAME 3: physics minigame where you try to give medicine but its like balancing an unstable object on your finger and their snout always avoids your mouse

KAREN is on stage right still talking on the phone.

KAREN
Finally, jesus you actually did what I told you to do!

JOY walks in stage left.

JOY
I'm sorry ma'am?

KAREN
Not you, my business partner, we run a trading firm.

JOY
I see, I see. Fiddles is going to be okay! Thanks for coming by, make sure to check that the food you give them doesnt look old or degraded.

KAREN
Are you kidding me? Don't be stupid, I would never do something like that!

JOY
Ma'am? Are you talking to me or...?

KAREN
Yes yes, alright. I'm coming back now, just getting out of the vet. Yeah it was really stressful but my dog's gonna be okay and--

KAREN starts walking out stage right.

JOY
That was...

WOE
a) Intense.
b) A disaster.

JOY
a) Yeah... I wonder if we'll see them again.
b) No don't say that. At least Fiddles is okay, right?
