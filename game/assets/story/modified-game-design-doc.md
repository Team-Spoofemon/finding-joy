"Finding Joy"


## Overview
"Finding Joy" is an interactive visual short story. You play as JOY's inner voice, and as she interacts with coworkers, clients, and cute animals--you play as her inner voice, affecting her decisions and sparring with her conciousness. This short story represents a vertical slice proof of concept that a team of students from SJSU can come together and actually ship a game with equal parts of work and effort, tying together disciplines like visual art, music, story, and programming.

## Settings
- PetCheap_FrontDesk - front desk of a vet clinic
- PetCheap_OperatingTable - operating table of a vet clinic with kennels
- PetCheap_BreakRoom - a small office breakroom with a coffee pot and some keurig cups
- CoffeeShop - a coffee shop looking at a table (for a date scene)
- JoyHouse_Bedroom - a bedroom that a single woman might have (sorry I dont know what those usually look like outside of a college setting)


## Dev Mechanics?
- the last spoken dialogue should still display for the player
- JOY turns to WOE: desaturate the background and have JOY face the player with an appropriate facial expression
- "wiggle" / "bounce" animation
    - every time a character talks, make sure the sprite wiggles to show they're doing something
    - when joy gets close to an animal and "fixes" them, the two sprites need to jiggle together to portray activity


## Music
- can we get some folley? things like a veterinarian office or a coffee shop, or that kind of thing?
- maybe a leitmotif for every scenario? so scene 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 all get leitmotifs? (even if that's just a retrograde or inversion or harmony)
