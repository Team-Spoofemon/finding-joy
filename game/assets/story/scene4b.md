# scene 4b: JOY and FAITH, coffee shop, date scene, guaranteed ends well

*stage:* JOY and FAITH enter from the right, (JOY first). FAITH ends up on the right. BISCUITS ends up in the center.

*stage:* FAITH is happy

FAITH
Wow, I never knew this coffee shop existed! And they allow pets!

*stage:* JOY is happy

JOY
Truthfully I had no idea until 5 minutes ago.

FAITH
Really? How'd you find out?

JOY
Oh, this co-worker I don't really like asked me out here and I turned them down.

*stage:* FAITH is thinking

FAITH
So you ditch them and ask me instead?

*stage:* JOY is fear

JOY
Oh no... I'm a bad person, aren't I?

*stage:* FAITH is fear

FAITH
No! No! Nah...

*stage:* JOY is sad

JOY
I'm so sorry, I shouldn't have done that--I!

*stage:* FAITH is happy

FAITH
I'm kidding, I'm kidding!

*stage:* JOY is happy

JOY
You scared me! Don't do that to me!

FAITH
I'm sorry, that was a bad joke.

FAITH
I guess I'm still jumpy since you helped BISCUITS.

JOY
And I'm sorry for asking you out so suddenly!

*stage:* FAITH is thinking

FAITH
What kind of company doesn't have a fraternization policy?

*stage:* JOY is angry

JOY
A bad one.

*stage:* JOY is neutral

JOY
But at least that means I can talk to you, right?

JOY
Speaking of which...

*stage:* FAITH is neutral

FAITH
Yeah?

*stage:* JOY is fear

JOY
Did you really mean what you said?

*stage:* FAITH is fear

FAITH
Wait which thing? I feel like I said a lot!

JOY
Did you mean what you said about being inspiring?

*stage:* FAITH is neutral

FAITH
Oh! Well, yes! Why wouldn't I mean that?

*stage:* JOY is sad

JOY
It's just...

*stage:* JOY turns to WOE

JOY
What am I even yapping about?!

WOE
a) I don't want you disappointed like I am.
b) It's hard sometimes. I don't feel inspiring.

JOY
a)
    JOY
    I don't want you to go into this just to get disappointed like me.

    *stage:* FAITH is sadness

    FAITH
    Are you disappointed?

    JOY
    Even if I have ten good encounters, having one awful moment ruins everything.

    *stage:* FAITH is neutral

    FAITH
    I work at my campus Pizza Hut. I know what you mean.

    *stage:* JOY is surprised

    JOY
    You do?

    FAITH
    Yup. Work isn't bad... sometimes people are. Thats why I'm thinking about vet school.

    *stage:* JOY is sad

    JOY
    Are you sure?


b)
    *stage:* JOY is sad

    JOY
    I love working with animals, you know?

    *stage:* FAITH is happy

    FAITH
    I could tell. That's why I said what I did.

    JOY
    But with everything going on--our funding just got cut.

    *stage:* FAITH is sad

    FAITH
    I'm so sorry. Which agency was it?

    JOY
    USDA. Without the VSGP grant, so many vet clinics will close.

    JOY
    I won't be able to work with animals anymore.

    *stage:* FAITH is neutral

    FAITH
    You'll pull through this.

    *stage:* JOY is happy

    JOY
    You sound so confident. Why do you think so?

    FAITH
    If you love what you do, you'll find a way to make it happen.

*stage:* FAITH is happy

FAITH
I know I'm a bit naive, but I still *want* to believe in things.

*stage:* JOY is thinking

JOY
Like what? What do you believe right now?

FAITH
No matter what, follow your passion.

FAITH
Even when the world is ending, follow your passion. Do what you can.

*stage:* JOY is sad

JOY
The world definitely looks like its ending.

*stage:* FAITH is neutral

FAITH
And maybe because of that, it's all the more reason.

*stage:* FAITH is happy

FAITH
Follow your passion, and that will fix the world.

*stage:* JOY is happy

JOY
Follow your passion, and that will fix the world?

FAITH
Yes.

FAITH
That's what I believe.
