"Finding Joy"


## Overview
"Finding Joy" is an interactive visual short story. You play as JOY's inner voice, and as she interacts with coworkers, clients, and cute animals--you play as her inner voice, affecting her decisions and sparring with her conciousness. This short story represents a vertical slice proof of concept that a team of students from SJSU can come together and actually ship a game with equal parts of work and effort, tying together disciplines like visual art, music, story, and programming.
