# scene 4a: JOY and SID, coffee shop, date scene, guaranteed ends poorly

*stage:* JOY and SID enter from the right, (SID first). SID ends up on the right.

*stage:* SID is angry.

SID
Man, the coffee is pricey and they still want tips?

JOY
What's wrong with tips?

SID
Prices are high, so business is doing fine! No tips needed!

*stage:* JOY is thinking.

JOY
PetCheap is doing fine, but we're not. Tips would be nice, right?

*stage:* SID is neutral.

SID
But when taxes go down they'll give us more money!

*stage:* JOY is neutral.

JOY
Taxes will go down? When is that happening?

SID
Yep! Right after all the waste and abuse gets thrown out!

JOY
The waste and abuse, huh?

*stage:* SID is happy.

SID
The right person is in charge! Good things are finally happening!

*stage:* JOY is angry.

JOY
What kind of good things?

SID
All of the wrong people are getting out of the way. It's a new age.

*stage:* JOY is sad.

JOY
That's one way of looking at it.

*stage:* SID is thinking.

SID
You're interested in this kind of stuff?

*stage:* JOY is neutral.

JOY
Of course. What happens over there affects over here.

*stage:* SID is happy.

SID
Sure, sure--but isn't this nice? We could do this every day, just you and me!

*stage:* JOY is fear.

JOY
Tempting offer--

*stage:* SID is happy.

SID
Such a good offer! Coffee, I pay for food--

*stage:* JOY is angry.

JOY
I mean it's a tempting offer, but I'll have to pass.

*stage:* SID is neutral.

SID
Huh?

SID
What do you mean?

*stage:* SID is angry.

SID
After I paid for coffee, what do you mean "you'll pass"?

*stage:* JOY is sad.

JOY
I mean that this thing is a one-time thing.

SID
You little... how can you be so ungrateful?

*stage:* JOY is angry.

JOY
Excuse me?

SID
I set this up and I did everything right!

*stage:* JOY is fear.

JOY
Um.

SID
What? Are you just too good for me or something?

*stage:* JOY turns to WOE.

JOY
The FUCK did he just ask?

WOE
a) Slap the bitch out of him.
b) De-escalate.
c) Slap the *bitch* out of him.

JOY
a)
    *stage:* JOY is happy

    JOY
    SID.

    SID
    What?

    JOY
    Not knowing how things work isn't sexy.

    *stage:* SID is sad

    JOY
    Goodbye.


b)
    *stage:* JOY is sad

    JOY
    I'm really sorry--I just don't think we would work well together.

    SID
    What?

    *stage:* SID is sad

    JOY
    See you at work tomorrow.


c)
    *stage:* JOY is angry

    JOY
    The VSGA.

    SID
    What the fuck is that?

    JOY
    The fucking Veterinary Services Grant Program. It's part of USDA. And one billion just got cancelled.

    *stage:* SID is sad

    SID
    Wait no... PetCheap doesn't!

    JOY
    We're the waste and abuse.

    *stage:* SID is angry

    SID
    Wait no... you lie!

    *stage:* JOY is thinking

    JOY
    I wonder when I'll see your ass at unemployment with me?

    *stage:* SID is sad

    SID
    They're only going after criminals! Not me!

    *stage:* JOY is angry

    JOY
    Maybe you can ask me out next time--when we're in line together.


*stage:* JOY exits to the left offscreen, SID is angry.

SID
So now I'm stuck with the bill?

*stage:* SID is angry

SID
Thanks a lot, feminism! Where's the equity here?

*stage:* SID is sad

SID
This is some dee-ee-aye bullshit!

*stage:* SHOPKEEPER approaches from the left facing right and ends up in the center.

SHOPKEEPER
Excuse me sir?

*stage:* SID is angry

SID
What?

SHOPKEEPER
The kind lady who just left gave us five dollars cash.

*stage:* SID is neutral

SID
What?

SHOPKEEPER
Would you like your refund as credits or sent to your card?

*stage:* SID is sad

SID
Card, please.
