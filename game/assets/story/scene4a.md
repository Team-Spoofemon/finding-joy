# scene 4a: JOY and IDOLA, coffee shop, date scene, guaranteed ends poorly

*stage:* JOY and IDOLA enter from the right, (IDOLA first). IDOLA ends up on the right.

*stage:* IDOLA becomes angry.

IDOLA
Man, the coffee is pricey and they still want tips?

JOY
What's wrong with tips?

IDOLA
Prices are high, so business is doing fine! No tips needed!

*stage:* JOY becomes thinking.

JOY
PetCheap is doing fine, but we're not. Tips would be nice, right?

*stage:* IDOLA becomes neutral.

IDOLA
But when taxes go down they'll give us more money!

*stage:* JOY becomes neutral.

JOY
Taxes will go down? When is that happening?

IDOLA
Yep! Right after all the waste and abuse gets thrown out!

JOY
The waste and abuse, huh?

*stage:* IDOLA becomes happy.

IDOLA
The right person is in charge! Good things are finally happening!

*stage:* JOY becomes angry.

JOY
What kind of good things?

IDOLA
All of the wrong people are getting out of the way. It's a new age.

*stage:* JOY becomes sad.

JOY
That's one way of looking at it.

*stage:* IDOLA becomes thinking.

IDOLA
You're interested in this kind of stuff?

*stage:* JOY becomes neutral.

JOY
Of course. What happens over there affects over here.

*stage:* IDOLA becomes happy.

IDOLA
Sure, sure--but isn't this nice? We could do this every day, just you and me!

*stage:* JOY becomes fear.

JOY
Tempting offer--

*stage:* IDOLA becomes happy.

IDOLA
Such a good offer! Coffee, I pay for food--

*stage:* JOY becomes angry.

JOY
I mean it's a tempting offer, but I'll have to pass.

*stage:* IDOLA becomes neutral.

IDOLA
Huh?

IDOLA
What do you mean?

*stage:* IDOLA becomes angry.

IDOLA
After I paid for coffee, what do you mean "you'll pass"?

*stage:* JOY becomes sad.

JOY
I mean that this thing is a one-time thing.

IDOLA
You little... how can you be so ungrateful?

*stage:* JOY becomes angry.

JOY
Excuse me?

IDOLA
I set this up and I did everything right!

*stage:* JOY becomes fear.

JOY
Um.

IDOLA
What? Are you just too good for me or something?

*stage:* JOY turns to WOE.

JOY
The FUCK did he just ask?

WOE
a) Slap the bitch out of him.
b) De-escalate.
c) Slap the *bitch* out of him.

JOY
a)
    *stage:* JOY becomes happy

    JOY
    IDOLA.

    IDOLA
    What?

    JOY
    Not knowing how things work isn't sexy.

    *stage:* IDOLA becomes sad

    JOY
    Goodbye.


b)
    *stage:* JOY becomes sad

    JOY
    I'm really sorry--I just don't think we would work well together.

    IDOLA
    What?

    *stage:* IDOLA becomes sad

    JOY
    See you at work tomorrow.


c)
    *stage:* JOY becomes angry

    JOY
    The VSGA.

    IDOLA
    What the fuck is that?

    JOY
    The fucking Veterinary Services Grant Program. It's part of USDA. And one billion just got cancelled.

    *stage:* IDOLA becomes sad

    IDOLA
    Wait no... PetCheap doesn't!

    JOY
    We're the waste and abuse.

    *stage:* IDOLA becomes angry

    IDOLA
    Wait no... you lie!

    *stage:* JOY becomes thinking

    JOY
    I wonder when I'll see your ass at unemployment with me?

    *stage:* IDOLA becomes sad

    IDOLA
    They're only going after criminals! Not me!

    *stage:* JOY becomes angry

    JOY
    Maybe you can ask me out next time--when we're in line together.


*stage:* JOY exits to the left offscreen, IDOLA becomes angry.

IDOLA
So now I'm stuck with the bill?

*stage:* IDOLA becomes angry

IDOLA
Thanks a lot, feminism! Where's the equity here?

*stage:* IDOLA becomes sad

IDOLA
This is some dee-ee-aye bullshit!

*stage:* SHOPKEEPER approaches from the left facing right and ends up in the center.

SHOPKEEPER
Excuse me sir?

*stage:* IDOLA becomes angry

IDOLA
What?

SHOPKEEPER
The kind lady who just left gave us five dollars cash.

*stage:* IDOLA becomes neutral

IDOLA
What?

SHOPKEEPER
Would you like your refund as credits or sent to your card?

*stage:* IDOLA becomes sad

IDOLA
Card, please.
