# ACT 1 - DAY 3 - SCENE 4 - INT. BREAK ROOM - DAY - JOY, exhausted from a minigame, gets asked out by POMPO.

JOY
I'm exhausted! One more thing and I swear to god--

POMPO
Well look who it is! And here I thought today couldn't get any better!

JOY
Oh here we go.

JOY turns around to face POMPO.

JOY
What have you got for me this time?

POMPO
Oh don't be like that! The other techs are covering for me and I just finished up with GLASHA's client so this time it's not about work!

JOY
And what is that?

POMPO
There's this great coffee place in the plaza next door--it has the best dark roast. Let's hang out after work and I'll take you there!

JOY
You're... asking me out?

POMPO
Now we're getting the idea! Whaddya say?

JOY turns to WOE.

JOY
This is a bad idea right? This is a terrible idea, right?

WOE
a) he's cute
b) at the very least, its a free coffee!
c) NO SHOT, shoot him down!

JOY
a) Bad JOY! Horny jail for you! Bad JOY!
b) Okay fine! I'll try to pretend his ick has magically vanished for the next 60 minutes! But there's NO WAY I'm letting this go further than coffee!
c) You know this guy will just ask again! I'll just turn him down at the shop while we talk. It'll be fineeeee!

JOY turns back.

JOY
Looks like I'll see you after shift.

POMPO
Sounds like a plan!
