# ACT 1 - DAY 3 - SCENE 6 - INT. HOME OF JOY - EVENING - JOY returns home in a huff.

JOY
I can't stand this. I can't fucking stand this.

JOY walks to the kitchen and starts preparing her dinner.

JOY
Why are there people like him in the world? Why?

WOE
a) You know why.
b) Death to men.
c) They're being emboldened.

JOY
a) Yeah, because nobody has ever told them no in their life! I get it.
b) But if I pulled that off, that's not a viable strategy for the existence of our species... plus illegal.
c) But what the hell am I supposed to do about that?

JOY
UGH! I fucked up--now when I come back tomorrow I'm going to have to deal with him and everyone's going to know and!!

JOY
Oh my god... did I do the right thing?

WOE
a) No.
b) Yes.

JOY
a) You're just trying to trick me.
b) Are you sure?

JOY
Sigh.

JOY finishes cooking her meal and starts warming it.

JOY
I'm just so done.

JOY
a) You'll be fine.
b) If tomorrow even comes, it's just going to have even more crazy shit in it.

JOY
Yeah.

JOY pauses.

JOY
This is fine. I'll deal with tomorrow when it comes. We're ok. I'm ok. We're ok right?

JOY
a) Yes.
b) No.

JOY
We're ok. I'm ok. It's ok.
