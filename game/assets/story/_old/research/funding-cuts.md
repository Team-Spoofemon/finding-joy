The Rural Practice Enhancement (RPE) grants will also be made to establish or expand veterinary practices in rural areas.

The Veterinary Services Grant Program (VSGP) is authorized by the 2014 Farm Bill. Initial funding for the program, $2.5 million, was appropriated in the FY 2016 budget. VSGP now has $4 million in funding. The legislation emphasizes two areas: Education, Extension, and Training (EET) and Rural Practice Enhancement (RPE).
