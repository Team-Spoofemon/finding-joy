# Story
"Finding Joy"


## Overview
"Finding Joy" is an interactive story where the player inhabits the inner voice of JOY, a young vetterinarian fresh out of school. She interacts with cowokers, clients, and their animals in a slice of life story until one day the clinic has to close. Just as she's about to personally call it quits JOY is reminded of her purpose and passion, and finds joy again.


## Themes
- on passion: do the things that bring you joy.
- on adversity: some things are your fault. some things are not your fault. knowing the difference and pushing past it is the lesson.
- on compassion: the best of us can empathize with the other without lived experience
- on lived experience: there is no better teacher than getting your face eaten by a leopard
- ludonarative: you play as JOY's inner voice, but THEY are telling THEIR story. You're just a passenger. THEY are in control.
- on gender and sex: (biological) sex is never mentioned, people just are as they are some characters present gender and some dont
- on capitalism: everyone sucks because they're underpaid. its that simple.
- on confidence: joy is her own character. the player is fighting with her as her subconcious. they like to talk to themself, calling herself "me". "stop doing that, me", "joy, you're a genius" "joy, you idiot, you did it again." joy is ultimately ALWAYS TRUE TO THEMSELF, even if they dont feel like it at the time.
