# Story
"Finding Joy"


## Overview
"Finding Joy" is an interactive story where the player inhabits the inner voice of JOY, a young vetterinarian fresh out of school. She interacts with cowokers, clients, and their animals in a slice of life story until one day the clinic has to close. Just as she's about to personally call it quits JOY is reminded of her purpose and passion, and finds joy again.


## Themes
- on passion: do the things that bring you joy.
- on adversity: some things are your fault. some things are not your fault. knowing the difference and pushing past it is the lesson.
- on compassion: the best of us can empathize with the other without lived experience
- on lived experience: there is no better teacher than getting your face eaten by a leopard
- ludonarative: you play as JOY's inner voice, but THEY are telling THEIR story. You're just a passenger. THEY are in control.
- on gender and sex: (biological) sex is never mentioned, people just are as they are some characters present gender and some dont
- on capitalism: everyone sucks because they're underpaid. its that simple.
- on confidence: joy is her own character. the player is fighting with her as her subconcious. they like to talk to themself, calling herself "me". "stop doing that, me", "joy, you're a genius" "joy, you idiot, you did it again." joy is ultimately ALWAYS TRUE TO THEMSELF, even if they dont feel like it at the time.

start with a dream sequence, they see flashing images of animals, the vet clinic she's going to, blurry images of her coworkers,



scene 60 - a FATEFUL ENCOUNTER with a young client, brings their cat, cat has a botfly hole in their chest, she explains what it could be, takes 1hr to deal with, the youg ? old? client leaves

scene 64 - young client comes back, no animal, just wants to thank you, brings you a small thank you card. it brightens up your day. they ask if they can have your number to call for house visits, you decline because the company doesnt allow it. (THIS WILL COME BACK LATER) they ask about becoming a vet, you say its all great.


scene 70 - client comes back just to talk, said they applied to vet school, you talk more real talk this time saying like its not glamorous. they leave feeling uneasy about the idea and dejected


scene 75 - client comes back and "spits in your face" about your pessimism, saying they'll do it anyway. at this point you feel really low, things look bad for job, country, etc. and you really need to hear it, but it doesnt sink in.




scene 80 - catastrophe, everyone is laid off--the VSGP funding was cut thanks to that fucking moron in the white house and his stooge. (this is my prediction of a TYPE of service they'll just cut)

scene 85 - crying, they dont understand, long political screed, i'm going to fucking kill them, etc.

scene 89 - you drive, lots of thoughts in your head

scene 90 - you arrive, see your boss stabilizing the bird, you could do it with 2 people, but its really a 3 person job, so now you invite the client to join. together the 2 hold it down so it doesnt hurt itself more, then you grab its other wing and start operating. i dont fucking know how eagles work.

scene 91 - minigame where you're trying to fix a broken bone

scene 92 - your boss strikes up a conversation, says i can't believe this is happening, you say of course it is. boss asks what should I do, the client replies saying what you WISH you could say ot their face.
the client says you fight it. fight for the least of us. fight not because you need it, fight because someone else does.

scene 93 - the client says, thats why you came, looking at the boss or rival or whatever, youre fighting for this creature who can't fight for itself in this situation. you dont do it because you need it, you do it because they need it.

scene 94 - joy finds her joy again. she proposes starting a clinic together. trump supporter and all.
